				<h3>ESD Website Redesign</h3>
				<h4>Academic Project (Information Architecture)</h4>
				<p>My redesign features a search functionality for efficient access and three target questions according to the website’s audiences. For the current/original design, see: <a href="http://www.esd.wa.gov" target="_blank">www.esd.wa.gov</a></p>

				<h3>Battlestar Galactica Design</h3>
				<h4>Academic Project (Information Architecture)</h4>
				<p>Being a television show that is no longer on the air, our website design targets our users with the lore of the series. Therefore, we featured an interactive colony map on our home page. There are also character profiles, ship information, news, episodes, popular clips, and a forum.</p>
				<a href="assets/img/work/wireframes/battlestar.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="proj-img" src="assets/img/work/wireframes/battlestar.jpg" alt="Battlestar Galactica Wireframe" width="450px"></a>
				<br><br>
				</p>

				<p>
				<h3>Aegean Cruises</h3>
				<h4>Academic Project (Information Architecture)</h4>
				<p>The home page features “excursions” and “chat” functions to the user, along with the options to create an itinerary, explore ports, and view the cruise calendar.</p>

					<h4 class="question">Are you aware that the office is in Orange County, California and are you willing to commute to the office or relocate so you can commute to the office?</h4>
					<p>Yes!</p>

					<h4 class="question">What are you looking for in your next position?</h4>
					<p class="response">I’ll be a college graduate in June and I’m eager to dive into the industry and be in a place where I can learn from the experienced and the experiences themselves. Designing is what gets me up and excited, so a position that allows me to create, collaborate, and positively impact peoples' lifestyles through User Experience is where I’d love to be. I’m also looking for an environment and work culture where my interests and passions align. Working with people whom I can form genuine friendships with through personal and industry-related interests is something I really value.</p>

					<h4 class="question">Do you have any experience with Data Visualization or data analysis? Have you ever worked with or are familiar any types of data monitoring dashboards such as Ganglia, Graphite, Zenoss, Splunk, Tableau, Gooddata, or something similar?</h4>
					<p class="response">I’m currently the Teaching Assistant for my major’s course on Information Visualization. A large portion of the assignments in the class use Tableau to create data visualizations, which I grade and assist students with. Some of the dashboards we work with involved choropleth maps, dot-density graphs, and location-based data sets. 
					</p>
					<p class="reponse"> 
					When I was at Blizzard Entertainment this past summer, I was the Data Visualization Intern in the Business Intelligence department. My main project was to design the user experience for a web portal that would allow users to organize their dashboards and navigate into Blizzard’s Tableau Server. Through the creation of that project, I became well versed with the architecture of Tableau Server and how it works.</p>

					<h4 class="question">You have a list of requirements and some user stories. What is the development process you would use to ensure a high quality product that is bug free and meets user expectations?</h4>
					<p class="response">To ensure a product is bug free, I would be sure to impose quality assurance testing throughout the entire project. When I was creating a web application at my previous internship, one of the ways I did this was to ask my mentor try out things in his environment. He had a different monitor resolution than mine, so a lot of the responsive design was tested for this way. In other situations, this kind of daily oversight could be done with other members of the team as a simple but regular check for bugs that might pop up throughout the entire development process. When the product is pretty substantial, more elaborate tests could be conducted such as testing all the paths and possible use cases. Additionally, it could be requested that development teams hack away at the product, and ensure no security loopholes exist. After the product is released, maintenance and support should be readily available in the event of post-release issues. 
					</p>
					<p class="reponse"> 
					As for meeting user expectations, I believe the majority of accomplishing this would be done in the research and early design stages of the product. Researching the right things and using the appropriate methods to do so make all the difference in discovering and backing up the design decisions that will be made. In particular, I think it is important to not just ask of the users, but to really understand the users. For example, it is crucial to distinguish the explicit from implicit—what users say versus what they do. Using a mixed methods approach (ex. contextual inquiries, interviews, observations, task-based experiments) is a good way to capture the breadth and depth of the user mentality. With a strong research process, design can be done with confidence.</p>

					<h4 class="question">If you were working on a complex application from conception to completion and maintenance, how would you develop a product that is easy to use and provides users with the best experience possible?</h4>
					<p class="response">
					I believe that good design is a process, not just an end result. To ensure that the product has great user experience, this is the design process I would perform (and what I followed at Blizzard for my web application project): 

					<ol>
						<li><strong>Identify the Problem</strong>: what is the need or significance of this application?</li>
						<li><strong>Goal</strong>: what is the desired result, what are we aiming for?</li>
						<li><strong>Deliverables</strong>: what can we be expected to produce for this application?</li>
						<li><strong>Research</strong>:
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>Research into the space</strong>: I’d familiarize myself with the context of the application by examining and reading documentation about existing architecture, playing around with related or connected applications, and performing a competitive analysis.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>User Research</strong>: the kinds of research methods used will vary depending on the amount of resources (ex. large/small amount of participants to work with, time constraints, size of research team). In this case, being a complex application, there should be use of contextual inquiries, interviews, and/or focus groups to dive deep into the desired design. Surveys and polls would not be enough to capture the depth of the complexity. 
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>Design</strong>:
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>Strategy</strong>: at this point I would begin to think about what features to implement (based on the findings from the user research), what the required techstack is, and what resources I’ll need to complete the project. This is where the research will back up the design decisions I make, which is a critical part in ensuring the usability and fulfillment for the users.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Sitemap, Information Architecture</strong>: using simple diagrams, I’d layout out the content of the site by level and category. 
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Userflows</strong>: flows would be created to demonstrate the paths a user could take in certain scenarios.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Sketches, Wireframes</strong>: I would start envisioning the UI of the application, utilizing visual design and layout principles to create interface designs. 
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Testing</strong>: before going into development, testing with paper prototypes or interactive wireframes can be done to ensure no time is wasted in development of designs that might change. Feedback would be incorporated into another iteration of the design, and tested again. The cycle would continue until a satisfactory product has resulted. 
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Development</strong>: here the application would enter the development stage. This might involve handing the project to another team.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Testing</strong>: during and after development, quality assurance testing will occur to ensure the security, durability, and performance of the application. It will be checked to make sure that it meets the standards and expectations originally defined in the goal. 
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Result</strong>: once the application has been thoroughly tested and all stones have been unturned, it can be prepared for release and finalized by stakeholders. 
						</li>
					</ol>	
					</p>
				
				<h4 class="question">Just to make sure we are on the same page salary wise, please share your most recent salary (list any bonuses separately) and your target compensation.</h4>
				<p class="response">As an upcoming college graduate, I’ve yet to have held a position that was salary based. My most recent internship was an hourly wage of $20.25. As an entry-level User Experience Designer, I’m looking for a salary in the range of $70,000 - $80,000. </p>
